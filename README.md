# hive-utils
Centrica Hive related tools that I am not too ashamed to admit authorizationing.

* hive_device_temperature.rb : assumes you have an existing api_token (this auth method is deprecated, evil, and will bestow upon you .. Scrutiny)

---------------------
Please feel free to Fork & Fix to use proper oauth instead of the extant and deprecated API Token method.
